A dummy program with 2 classes to represent Eagles and snakes to understand object-oriented programming concepts.
Every eagle has age and speed of flight
Every snake had mass and power of venom
Eagle below 12 months old will grow its speed rapidly, on the other hand older eagle tend to decrease speed as they grow older
An Eagle can eat a snake if its speed is greater than snake venom power. Hence snake is killed and eagle grows by 1 month
else snake's mass incereses by 10
As the snake grows its venom power increments
Farm class instantiates the eagle and snake objects and performs actions for them respectively
# Tasks performed:
